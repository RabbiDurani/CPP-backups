/*STL --->Standard Template Library
*Components of STL  --->1.Containers 2.Algorithms & 3.Iterators
1.Containers --> Container is an object which stores data. We have different containers having their own benefits. These are the implemented template classes for our use, which can be used just by including this library. You can even customize these template classes.
2.Algorithms --> Algorithms are a set of instructions which manipulates the input data to arrive at some desired result. In STL, we have already written algorithms, for example, to sort some data structure, or search some element in an array. These algorithms use template functions.
3.Iterators --> Object which points to an element of a container.Iterators are objects which refer to an element in a container. And we handle them very much similarly to a pointer. Their basic job is to connect algorithms to the container and play a vital role in manipulation of the data.

Containers are of thee types -->
1.Sequence Container --> A sequence container stores that data in a linear fashion. Refer to the illustration below to understand what storing.Sequence containers include Vector, List, Dequeue etc. These are some of the most used sequence containers.
2.Associative Container --> An associative container is designed in such a way that enhances the accessing of some element in that container. It is very much used when the user wants to reach some element faster. Some of these containers are, Set, Multiset, Map.
3.Derived Container -->  As the name suggests, these containers are derived from either the sequence or the associative containers. They often provide you with some better methods to deal with your data. They deal with real life modelling. Some examples of derived containers are Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, etc*/
